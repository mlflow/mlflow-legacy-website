MLflow Tensorflow Integration
==============================

Introduction
------------

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible
ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art
in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

MLflow has built-in support (we call it MLflow Tensorflow flavor) for Tensorflow workflow, at a high level
in MLflow we provide a set of APIs for:

- **Simplified Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, metrics, and models during model training.
- **Experiments Management**: Store your Tensorflow experiments in MLflow server, and you can view and share them from MLflow UI.
- **Effortless Deployment**: Deploy Tensorflow models with simple API calls, catering to a variety of production environments.

5 Minute Quick Start with the MLflow Tensorflow Flavor
-------------------------------------------------------

To get a quick overview of how to use the MLflow Tensorflow flavor, please read the quickstart guide. It
will walk you through the basics of tracking Tensorflow experiments.
