# MLflow Evaluation

Classic ML Evaluation System

This documentation covers MLflow's **classic evaluation system** (`mlflow.evaluate`) which uses `EvaluationMetric` and `make_metric` for custom metrics.

**For GenAI/LLM evaluation**, please use the system at [GenAI Evaluation](/docs/3.6.1/genai/eval-monitor.md) which uses:

* `mlflow.genai.evaluate()` instead of `mlflow.evaluate()`
* `Scorer` objects instead of `EvaluationMetric`
* Built-in LLM judges and scorers

**Important**: These two systems are **not interoperable**. `EvaluationMetric` objects cannot be used with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`, and `Scorer` objects cannot be used with `mlflow.evaluate()`.

## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

**Model evaluation** is the cornerstone of reliable machine learning, transforming trained models into trustworthy, production-ready systems. MLflow's comprehensive evaluation framework goes beyond simple accuracy metrics, providing deep insights into model behavior, performance characteristics, and real-world readiness through automated testing, visualization, and validation pipelines.

MLflow's evaluation capabilities democratize advanced model assessment, making sophisticated evaluation techniques accessible to teams of all sizes. From rapid prototyping to enterprise deployment, MLflow evaluation ensures your models meet the highest standards of reliability, fairness, and performance.

## Core Evaluation Capabilities[​](#core-evaluation-capabilities "Direct link to Core Evaluation Capabilities")

### Automated Model Assessment[​](#automated-model-assessment "Direct link to Automated Model Assessment")

MLflow evaluation transforms complex model assessment into simple, reproducible workflows:

python

```
import mlflow
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

# Load and prepare data
wine = load_wine()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    wine.data, wine.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create evaluation dataset
eval_data = X_test
eval_data["target"] = y_test

with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, name="model")

    # Comprehensive evaluation with one line
    result = mlflow.models.evaluate(
        model="models:/my-model/1",
        data=eval_data,
        targets="target",
        model_type="classifier",
        evaluators=["default"],
    )
```
